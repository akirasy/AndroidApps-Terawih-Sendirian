# Terawih Sendirian

## Aims
For muslims who are unable to go to musolla/masjid due to various reason.
This app will act as a guide in performing Solah Terawih.

## Idea
I had difficulty to do Solat Terawih on my own because of my memory weakness.
Many times i forgot how many rakaat have i prayed.
So i created this app as a guide.
